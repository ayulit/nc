		<h3>GOALS</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>To learn OOP basics: basic principles of writing a class, getters/setters, <code>this</code> keyword.</li>
		  <li>To get familiar with some methods of {@link Object} and with {@link Comparable} interface.</li>
		  <li>To be able to use some java.lang and java.itil API: {@link String}, {@link Double}, {@link Arrays}.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p/>
		  TASK<br/>
		  Implement a class storing a single complex number with basic mathematical operations on it.<br/>
		  Instances of the class must be comparable, cloneable and representable as String (in the common format).
		  <p/>
		  REQUIREMENTS<ul>
		  <li>The complex number consists of two components: real part (re) and imaginary part (im).
		    They should be stored as private fields (members of the class) of type double or Double.
		    After instantiation of the number with default constructor both re and im must be equal to 0.</li>
		  <li>Every math operation on the number (add, negate, multiply methods) should change the state of this object 
		    not creating a new object (this requirement is intended to save memory and to lower calculation time). 
		    For a caller's convenience, all these methods (math operations) return this object itself.</li>
		  <li>The common requirement for any task (to check it online) is to declare your class as follows:<br/>
		  <code>public class ComplexNumberImpl implements ComplexNumber {  } </code></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p/>
		  NOTES<ul>
		  <li>When coded with the methods of this interface, formulas like z = x-y^2 could look like this:<br/>
		   <code>ComplexNumber z = x.add(y.copy().multiply(y).negate());</code><br/>
		   where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> are objects of type ComplexNumber.</li>
		  <li>The task can be solved without any knowledge of Exceptions, but if you know that topic 
		   explicit generation of {@link NumberFormatException} in {@link #set(String)} method is recommended.</li>
		  <li>It's recommended (but not required) to have the following set of constructors:<br/>
		    <code>public ComplexNumberImpl(double re, double im);</code><br/>
		    <code>public ComplexNumberImpl(String value);</code><br/>
		    <code>public ComplexNumberImpl();</code> (this no-argument constructor is required by the checking system).</li>
		  <li>If you don't understand the mathematical meaning of the complex number you can read e.g. 
		   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">Complex Number at Wikipedia</a>.</li>
		  <li>A professional Java implementation of this concept can be found here:
